                    <p>Over an 18 month period both of these waste sites were built. Mountsorrel was a brand new site
                        and
                        Lount was an extension and re-development of the existing site.</p>
                    <p>Works involved everything from site soil strip, cut and fill earthworks, foundations, precast and
                        in-situ concrete walls, drainage, yard concreting, kerbing, service installation, new welfare
                        and
                        office construction and tarmac surfacing. Both sites were a new strategy on waste
                        handling/disposal
                        and were completed ahead of schedule, allowing early customer use.</p>

                <div class="case-text">
                    <p>Installation of new sewerage system to prevent downstream flooding to the town of Ashbourne. Work
                        involved construction of new on-line storage tank pipeline within Conservation Area land along
                        with
                        upgraded chambers and installation of throttle system to prevent flooding during heavy rain or
                        prolonged downpours.</p>
                    <p>Pipe sizes ranged from 150 -1200mm and work was not allowed to start until Autumn due to
                        ecological
                        constraints.</p>
                    <p>The work was completed well ahead of schedule even though the weather was ‘doing its worst’. The
                        pipeline became operational and even though the final reinstatement to the grazing land had to
                        be
